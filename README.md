## 1. Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1.1 Prerequisites

You'll need Node installed on your machine, the best way to install/manage
Node versions is to use Volta.

- [Volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) - the Hassle-Free JavaScript
  Tool Manager

```
$ curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

Once Volta is installed, install Node (pinned to `lts` on package.json)

```
$ volta install node
```

### 1.2 Installing and Running Locally

```
$ npm install
```

Now you can start the development server by running the command below:

```
$ npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 2. Contributing

To contribute features or bug fixes:

1. create a new branch off the `master` branch with the name of your feature or
   bug fix (e.g. `chore/update_dependency` branch);

2. once you're finished with your changes open a pull request from your 
   branch to `master`.

We use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to 
enforce commits that follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

The most common and useful types are `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, 
`refactor` and `test`. Examples of valid commit messages would be:

```
$ git commit -m "docs: updated README"
```

or

```
$ git commit -m "feat: added Profile component"
```

## 3. Testing

Unit and integration tests use Jest, you can run the interactive test monitor with the following command:

```
$ npm test
```
